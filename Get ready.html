        <p><u><h2><p align = "Left"> Introduction</h2></u></p>
       <p>This is a step by step guide from a beginner on how to learn and master using the combination of html and css</p>
        <p><u><h2>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)</h2></u>
            A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a documnet written in a markup language e.g.html
           <h3><U>Building A Website</U></h3> 
            you need...
           <p>1.Structure (skeleton)= html</p>
            <p>2.Style= CSS</p>
           <p>3.Fuctionality= JavaScript</p> 
           <p id="wk"align="center"><b>*CSS works within a html document*</b></p>
           there are 3-ways in which you can apply CSS properties to html elements</p>
           <p id="p1"><b>a.Inline</b></p>
           In terms of inline application it means that you would apply css elements to the particular line of code that you would 
           like to change even though some other lines of code may share the same format as that line you are editng, the changes will only 
           apply to the specific line of code you are working on.</p>
           <p id="p2"><b>b.Internal</b></p>
           When working with internal application you put the (style) tags within the (body) section to make sure that the changes
           you make apply to the lines of code that share the same format.</p>
           <p id="p3"><b>c.External (works the best)</b></p>
           <p id="p4" style="background-color:rgb(0, 255, 183);">This application is quiet special because you can apply the changes to different pages in a website using only one file. You first need to create
           a different file saving it as a css document then adding the css styles of your choice that you would like to apply to your html file/web, then using the (link rel="" href"css file name") function to link the two and always keep in mind 
           that the <u>rel</u> name should always be <u>stylesheet.</u></p></br>
           <p><u><b>Text Formats</b></u></p>
           When you have decided on the contents of your page it is important to choose the font-styles you would like to use. When dealing with 
           font-styles in CSS they are not called "font-styles" but "font-family". The fonts used in CSS are much more different from the ones you would normally use in html alone
           they are designed to have more flair and artistic effects to attract the user to your website, but not all of them are compatible with all the browsers so it depends on the browser you are using. You can manually add the font-family by name
           or you can go to a website and download all the font-family groups(link below).</p>
